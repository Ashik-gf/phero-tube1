        <h5>1:Discribe var, Let, const
            <p>var:
                Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally-scoped, but not block-scoped.
                If declared within a function, the variable is limited to that function's scope.
                If declared outside of any function, the variable is globally accessible throughout the entire script.
                Variables declared with var are subject to "hoisting," meaning they are moved to the top of their scope during the compilation phase.
                Because of hoisting, you can access and use a var variable before it's actually declared in the code.
                <br>
                let:
                Variables declared with let are block-scoped, meaning their scope is limited to the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are defined.
                let variables are not hoisted to the top of their scope like var variables.
                They can be updated or reassigned within their scope.
                <br>
                const:
Variables declared with const are block-scoped and also have a constant value, meaning they cannot be reassigned after their initial value assignment.
const variables must be assigned a value when declared, and this value cannot be changed.
Like let, const variables are not hoisted to the top of their scope.
